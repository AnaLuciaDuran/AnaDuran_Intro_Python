    "###Â Exercise 4: SMS spam classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam filtering is a type of text categorization, such as language identification and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "How we represent text by means of features?\n",
    "- _bag of words_: boolean codifying the presence of the indexed words (`nltk.FreqDist`)\n",
    "- _term frequency (tf)_: frequency of the indexed word in the sentence (`nltk.text.tf`)\n",
    "- _term-frequency times inverse document-frequency (tf/idf)_: as above re-weighting to avoid effect of too common words such as english word _the_ (`nltk.text.tf_idf`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SMS Spam Collection Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "source: UCI repository\n",
    "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection\n",
    "- 5574 examples\n",
    "- 2 classes: ham and spam\n",
    "- Example: `ham    What you doing?how are you?`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment design:**\n",
    "- single validation (50% - 50%)\n",
    "- randomly shuffle\n",
    "- punctuation removed\n",
    "- strings lowered\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Prepare the train and test dataset following the experiment design listed above\n",
    "2. Using the bag of words, convert the train and test set into a vector of occurrences. This will be useful in order to use it as an input for a clasifier.\n",
    "3. Train and test a simple kNN classifier\n",
    "4. Compute the confusion matrix and analyze the results\n",
    "5. **Optional:** Perform additional experiments with different experiment design. Some suggestions:\n",
    "    - Different weight for the single validation\n",
    "    - k-Fold cross-validation\n",
    "    - Different text processing (punctuation vs. no punctuation, strings lowered vs. not lowered)\n",
    "    - Dfferent parameters for the k-NN classifier (k, distance)\n",
    "    - Different algorithms for the classifier (e.g. SVM)\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Optional:** Extend the solution to the use of lemmas and other preprocess issues (after tomorrow's class)."
